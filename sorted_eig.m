%SORTED_EIG Compute the sorted eigenvalue decomposition of a square matrix
%
%   Inputs:
%       X:          matrix to decompose
%       direction:  'ascend','descend' for ordering of eigenvectors and
%           eigenvalues
%
%   Outputs:
%       V_sorted:   matrix of eigenvectors sorted according to the
%           eigenvalues
%       S_sorted:   diagonal matrix of sorted eigenvalues
